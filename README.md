This is a toolkit for comprehensive semi-automated vectorisation of cadastral map series with a built-in feedback loop to iteratively improve prediction capabilities and reduce mending effort over time. Each feature is an individual binary segmentation model, and any combination of features can be selected and compiled from map patch predictions into a GeoPackage of full map vector layers. Land parcels are derived separately, by partitioning the boundary-line network using the recorded apportionment points as seeds (a point-seeded watershed), so no per-parcel model training is required.

The pipeline was initially developed for use with the [Tithe Maps of England and Wales]() to target:
- Solid boundary lines between land parcels with a modified version of [this improved U-Net architecture]() and model weights that have only been trained on tithe map training data (~300 map patches across 12(?) sample maps). Symbology such as building outlines and watercourses that are not land parcel boundaries, yet are morphologically identical, were also annotated to avoid bad prediction from the model's lack of additional semantic knowledge.
- Dashed bounary lines using a custom-made U-Net architecture with a pretrained EfficientNetB0 encoder that learns to redraw dashed boundary lines as if they were continuous using a Gaussian-blurred version of the linear annotation training set. 
- Water (watercourses and waterbodies), land cover symbology (all different symbology together in one class to account for inter-map sheet variability requiring post-prediction manual classification aka filling in an attribute field), and house footprints with [MapSAM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06971). Derived from SAM and fine-tuned for the historic map domain, minimal few-shot fine-tuning is required to produce high-accuracy prediction for each class. 
- Text with the use of the [MapTextPipeline runner](https://github.com/maps-as-data/MapTextPipeline) with model weights built from David Rumsey historical map collection ([add link to these]()). 



Download's and Pre-requisites:
- This pipeline was built in Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) because of package and library agreements. 
- The anaconda environments are set up to work best with an NVIDIA GPU.
- Set up the following conda environments:
```python
conda env create -f envs/maptools.yml   # annotation, patchify, and vectorising
conda env create -f envs/polygons.yml   # used for both polygon (MapSAM) and text steps 
conda env create -f envs/lines.yml      # used for both solid and dashed line steps (U-Net models)
Running through the pipeline:
```
- Clone the necessary repositories into the `models/` folder
- Add model weights into the `models/base/` folder from [my huggingface](https://huggingface.co/ww357)

Running through the pipeline:

00_download:
```python
conda activate maptools

# one-off: catalogue every NLW tithe map (~1,074 maps; resumable)
python run.py download discover

# download one or more maps (scan + parcel points + georeferencing)
python run.py download fetch --county Anglesey        # 'fetch' == the downloader's 'download'
                                                      # or --pids "Llangynllo,4634773"

# export toolkit-ready sheets INTO data/raw and data/parcel_points
python run.py download export-toolkit --county Anglesey

python steps/00_download/tithe_downloader.py --help # for clarity
```
Two files in this step:
- `tithe_downloader.py` — the downloader (copied from `https://github.com/ww357/Vectorise-Welsh-Tithes` (will change this to `Welsh-Tithes-Downloader`)
  repo). Its catalogue database and downloaded scans live in
  `steps/00_download/tithe_maps/` (gitignored). 
- `download.py` — a thin wrapper `run.py` calls. It forwards the downloader's
  subcommands and, for `export-toolkit`, fills in `--toolkit-dir` with this
  toolkit's root automatically.
This will write (per sheet):
- `data/raw/<sheet>/<sheet>.tif` — north-up **EPSG:27700** GeoTIFF at **0.5 m/px**,
  exactly what `run.py patchify` expects.
- `data/parcel_points/<sheet>_points.gpkg` — one seed point per apportionment
  parcel, EPSG:27700, matched to the raster. The per-sheet name (`<sheet>_points`)
  is auto-detected by the parcel steps — no per-sheet config change.

The seed-point layer carries `rowid` (1..N, the join key the parcel vectorise step
uses), `Easting`/`Northing`, the apportionment attributes (`ParishName, ParcelID,
Landowner, Occupier, FieldName_Desc, AreaName, CultivationState`), the imperial
area as separate `Acres` / `Rods` / `Perches` columns, and a computed
**`area_hectares`** total, plus `rent_decimal_pounds`, `pixel_x`/`pixel_y`,
`map_pid`, `nlw_id`.

```python
## Step 01 - Patchify
conda activate maptools 
python "steps/01_patchify/draw_mask.py" --sheet MapSheetName
# run this to interactively make mask of map area on the document if necessary 
# to reduce patches for inference (or this mask can be made in another programme):
python "steps/01_patchify/patchify.py" --sheet MapSheetName
# slice GeoTIFF into 512px patches (use --mask flag if no mask is auto-found)

## Step 02 - Annotate
python "steps/02_annotate/annotate.py" --sheet MapSheetName
# open labelme to draw boundary lines and feature polygons
python "steps/02_annotate/export_masks.py" --sheet MapSheetName
# convert labelme JSON to binary mask PNGs per feature label

## Step 03 - Fine-tune (Boundaries - U-Net)
conda activate lines
python "steps/03_finetune/lines/train.py" --sheet MapSheetName --name map_v1
# fine-tune boundary U-Net, checkpoints on path-F1

## Step 03 - Fine-tune (Features - MapSAM)
conda activate polygons
python "steps/03_finetune/polygons/train.py" --sheet MapSheetName --feature FeatureName --name map_v1
# fine-tune SAM DoRA weights for one feature class (repeat per feature)

## Step 04 - Predict
conda activate lines
python "steps/04_predict/lines/predict.py" --sheet MapSheetName
# run U-Net on all patches, skips manually annotated ones
conda activate polygons
python "steps/04_predict/polygons/predict.py" --sheet MapSheetName --feature FeatureName1 FeatureName2 FeatureName3 ...
# run MapSAM on all patches for listed features & run text prediction if "text" is specified

## Step 05 - Vectorise
conda activate maptools
python "steps/05_vectorise/lines/vectorise.py" --sheet MapSheetName # stitch and vectorise boundary lines
python "steps/05_vectorise/polygons/vectorise.py" --sheet MapSheetName # stitch and vectorise polygons
python "steps/05_vectorise/text/text_to_vector.py" --sheet MapSheetName # stitch and vectorise text

## Parcels - point-seeded watershed (run after the boundary lines are vectorised)
conda activate polygons
python "steps/04_predict/parcels/parcel_segment.py" --sheet MapSheetName
# partition the stitched boundary raster into parcels, seeded by apportionment points
python "steps/05_vectorise/parcels/parcel_vectorise.py" --sheet MapSheetName
# join apportionment attributes and write the 'parcels' layer to the GeoPackage

## Step 06 - Feedback loop
conda activate lines
python "steps/06_feedback/lines/feedback.py" --sheet MapSheetName

# Output: data/outputs/MapSheetName.gpkg
```
